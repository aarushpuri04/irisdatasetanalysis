This project details a methodical approach to analyzing a comprehensive iris dataset. It contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The goal of this analysis is to explore the dataset, identify patterns and relationships between the features, and gain insights into the differences among the three species.
